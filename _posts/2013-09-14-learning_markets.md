I've written before about the [use of market research in online learning](http://rpietro.github.io/situated_cognition,/big_data/2013/08/08/agile_online_courses/), the main gist being that before you invest a ton of time on a course product with some new spin, you should first test the market. In other words, the principle should be [pull](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Pull-Smartly-Things-ebook/dp/B0039KO9ZK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1378912778) rather than push.

But then if your new learning product involves a new type of experience, then it could be hard or next to impossible to convey what that new experience would be in a market research survey. For example, if your course is about to create a new level of personalization and interaction, that experience won't get through in a short description or even in a well-crafted video. People have to try it so that they might get a better idea on whether they would like to pay for the product and exactly how much they would be willing to pay.

This is why I am now thinking that market research might be simply the first iterative cycle in an Agile chain. The process then should start with a market research, followed by an immediate release of a [minimum viable product (MVP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). Only then increments to that product are made through a series of small randomized experiments. 

In this context, market research is not a definitive step, do or die. Instead, market research is just the start of an extensive experiment where the path can be re-oriented dynamically oriented as you go. So, if a given niche wants personalization, then given then the type of personalization they want. If their main need is deep content, then deep content it is, and so on.

I looked all over for a list of international databases containing fields on specific items (questions) from students of any age, focusing on any kind of educational assessment. Given the large number of psychometricians around the world, I was surprised to not find anything so far. 

Solution was to create a [list on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_databases_on_individual_student_achievement_tests), which is now organically growing over the past few weeks. If you have any other sources or know of people who would, by all means feel free to add it yourself or add comment in the source code and I will add it for you. The goal here is to make it easier for researchers and students to quickly find data sets that might be used for research papers, item banks, educational policy evaluation, among many other purposes.

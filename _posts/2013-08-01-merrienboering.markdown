I think I am coining a new verb, assuming others haven't done it before me. The 
verb is *merrienboering*, or the ability to turn a topic into Merrienboer's Instructional Design Model called [Complex Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Steps-Complex-Learning-Four-Component-ebook/dp/B009WMBP7O/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1375382850&sr=8-3)

I will likely post at some point about my understanding of the main components behind Merrienboer's model, but one of the most attractive features to me is that you start the learning process by getting a complete or whole task completed. That's right, no more learning one piece at a time to only then putting it all together at the very end. A *life is short, eat dessert first* sort of attitude, which I personally connect with the hacker/agile/lean culture. In other words, hack your way into the simplest possible solution, and only start making it fancier.

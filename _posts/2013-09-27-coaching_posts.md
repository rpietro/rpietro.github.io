I am starting a series of posts I plan on publishing about practical suggestions for researchers. My experience stems from having [published in clinical and health services research](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F5m0nQoAAAAJ&hl=en) for many years, as well as having run a coaching program targeting junior faculty members at Duke University and a few other institutions. All this means is that my posts will frequently use examples related to the biomedical and data sciences, but I also believe that most of the content can be extrapolated to other research areas.

Each of these posts will be available in English and Portuguese versions, usually posted in consecutive days. They will also be published to the respective Global and Brazilian versions of a Facebook Group page, the Brazilian page [already being available]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/578812732155954/?bookmark_t=group). Other languages might follow depending on whether the posts generate some interest. 

Enough said, let's get to work ...

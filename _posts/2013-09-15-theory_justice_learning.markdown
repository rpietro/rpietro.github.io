I propose to teach you differential equations, but you have never taken calculus before. Then I announce that your whole life depends on your final score.

It's clear that this course will be a massacre at least, very few people would dispute that. But then this is, in a very simplistic way, the very basis of [Rawl's Theory of Justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice). In other words, to assume that any two people will be coming from the exact level when you give them an "equal opportunity" is just insane. 

Now, if this is so easy to understand with a simple example, why is it so hard to bring to all other parts of life?

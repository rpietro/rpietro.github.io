I recently came one more time across a post on [what is it like to understand advanced mathematics?](https://plus.google.com/106268032364497388036/posts/3PGuie75xmx). Although the number of people reaching the level of mastery described in this post are certain few, I wonder what would be the differences in the type of expertise and insight that would be developed when comparing traditional mathematicians vs. those trained primarily from an experimental perspective. I am actually not sure whether there are people who are solely trained as experimental mathematicians, but even a comparison with the ones primarily focusing on experimental mathematics would be fairly interesting. 

Reason for my interest in this topic is that I identify this as the geek/Agile/constructivist/Merrienboer way of doing mathematics, something that [Jonathan Borwein](http://www.carma.newcastle.edu.au/jon/) has been advocating for a while through several books, including his latest [An Introduction to Modern Mathematical Computing: With Mathematica](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Mathematical-Computing-ebook/dp/B00A7QHJR4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1375387549&sr=1-1). Perhaps making the book focused on, say, [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) would make it more widely accessible, but regardless this is a very exciting field for mathematical education.

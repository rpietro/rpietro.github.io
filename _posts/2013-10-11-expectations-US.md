I frequently get that question about what exactly is expected from a researcher coming to the US. While the points below are largely my own perspective, I don't think they will deviate all that much from what other mentors might think. 

But before we dive into these points, one question you might ask is why would I want to work with research? Well, even if you don't intend to become an academician, learning the way a researcher thinks is valuable as you will start dissecting any situation into small parts and then assembling a plan of action. But this is a topic for later, for now, let's take a look at some of the most common expectations:

## Work ethic and focus

First and foremost, it is expected that you will be diligently working on the projects that you and and your mentor might have decided. I have had situations where researchers who were expected to be fully dedicated to their project end up spending up to 85% of their time with something else. That's not good at all. So, get together with your mentor, define exactly what the expectations might be, and then get to work to deliver.

## Being proactive

It's a common practice in other countries that your mentor will tell you about every single step you should take. In other words, do this, don't do that, and you are not allowed to do anything unless you have my permission. Well, in the US this is not the expectation. You will be given problems to solve, and from then on you are expected to be proactive and go after solutions. Do not expect that your mentor will act as a parent, you have to be proactive, control your own schedule, and ask for help when you need it.



## Stay out of trouble

This is probably more for very young researchers who often times are getting out of their country for the first time. Remember, you are an adult and you have to be responsible. It is not because you are out of your country that laws will not apply to you. Over the years I have heard of students falsifying documents, stealing credit cards from others, drinking when they shouldn't, among many other things. Well, I probably don't have to say why you shouldn't be doing that.

## Group work

In research, and in probably almost every single field out there, group work is the rule rather than the exception. This means you have to know how to work with others. This includes things such as observing the local dressing code (what you were wearing in your country might not be acceptable in other countries), how loud you are (shouting is OK in some countries and not in others), among many other details. So, the best rule here is to observe the rules around and you try to blend. That doesn't mean you can't have your own culture, but express yourself in a way that will not bother or offend others.

## English language

Although no one will ever expect you to have a perfect English, you won't get much done if you don't have an English that is at least good enough to understand what others are saying and also to make yourself understood. So, as much as you can, try to come with good enough language skills so that this won't get in your way from getting things done. 

## Additional skills
Anything that you might be able to bring to the team that is not already available will make you a rising star. Now, which skills you can bring to the table will depend on what kind of group you decide to join. 

One example that is almost invariably popular is the ability to deal with quantitative data. Since most research teams are focused on a specific content area, becoming "the local data analysis expert" is almost a guaranteed path toward becoming highly dependable to your group.

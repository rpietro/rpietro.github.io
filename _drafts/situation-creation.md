situation as something that is formed by other people, tools, the environment, technology, and the person's body
but then the other people filter which situations are presented to me as an individual
in order to identify which situations can be fabricated one would have to create certain "rules" of how humans will respond
these rules will be created based on agile models where quick tests and response are measured under different circumstances

In a number of countries university professors are rewarded when they establish research collaborations with peers from other countries. This post will focus primarily on an average American researchers would consider an attractive proposal to collaborate, but will likely generalize to people in other countries. 

Let us get started:

## Check the researcher's profile

Before you approach a researcher, you have to have a very good understanding of their work. If you propose something that is outside of her interests, she will likely not pay attention to you. So, check her publications and funding history. 

Publications will be available in public databases such as [Google Scholar](), [Pubmed](), or ISI(). But only publications are not enough, since they usually represent what this researcher started working on two to three years ago when the project was started. Active funded projects tend to be a better representation of what this person might be working on right now. The best available source is an online CV, if available. Other sites include [NIH]() and [NSF]()


## If possible, meet the researcher in person for a conversation

Cold calls or emails tend to be fairly impersonal, and so if you have an opportunity to meet the researcher in person, by all means try to do it. If you have the resources, offer to pay the researcher's group a visit, which will certainly guarantee a long and potentially interesting conversation.


## If you plan to start with a message, be short and objective

If you don't plan on meeting the researcher in person and your first contact will be through email, make your message short and objective. Important components should be who you are, what kind of collaboration you have in mind, and specifically what kinds of resources you could contribute toward this potential collaboration.

Examples of resources you could bring to the table include things such as a database, a potential joint submission of a funding proposal in your country, or something that you think might be of interest to the researcher you are approaching. At the end of the message make yourself available for a conversation by phone or using a regular video conference system such as [Skype]() or [Google Hangout]().


## Prepare a CV

Although not necessary, having a public CV in English is interesting so that your potential collaborator can evaluate what you have done. Public CVs are easy to create using tools such as [Google Scholar](http://fyi.libmedia.nymc.edu/?p=2517). 

If you are a methods specialist, another way would be to store your analysis scripts in a repository with high visibility such as [GitHub](https://github.com/). This would not only tell your collaborator that you might have a certain skill, but actually demonstrate in practice what you are capable of doing.


## Language skills

This should be obvious, but your language skills have to be good enough to understand what will be mentioned as well as to understand what that person will say. If that might not be the case, then you might consider choosing another person whose language is something you feel more at home.

## Consistency and reliability over time

This is probably one of the single most important points if a conversation is initiated: Be consistent and reliable. If you promise something, make sure you deliver exactly what was promised when you have promised it. If you established a deadline, be absolutely sure that you will deliver at least at the date you defined.

In a number of countries university professors are rewarded when they establish research collaborations with peers from other countries. This post will focus primarily on an American perspective on what would constitute incentives toward the establishment of collaborations with researchers from other countries. So, let us get started:

## Check the researcher's profile

publications usually represent the work they have performed many years ago, while active funding is more likely to be something the researcher might be interested in

## Meet the researcher for a conversation
Conferences in the US or your country, visits to their research group


## If you plan to start with a message, be short and objective

If you don't plan of meeting the researcher in person and your first contact will be by email, make your message short and objective. Important components should be who you are and specifically what kind of resources you could contribute: Examples include a database, joint submission of a funding proposal in your country, or something that you think might be of interest to the researcher you are approaching. Then make yourself available for a conversation.


## Prepare a CV

Although not necessary, having a public CV in English is interesting so that your potential collaborator can evaluate what you have done. Public CVs are easy to create using tools such as [Google Scholar](http://fyi.libmedia.nymc.edu/?p=2517). If you are a methodologist, another way would be to store your analysis scripts in a repository with high visibility such as [GitHub](https://github.com/). This would not only tell your collaborator that you might have a certain skill, but actually demonstrate in practice what you are capable of doing.


## Bring something to the table

In order to make the collaboration attractive, you should present something that might be attractive to your potential collaborators. Examples include data you might have already collected or the ability to collect data that would be aligned with an existing project conducted by your potential collaborators. Another attractive option would be for you to be a methodology expert who could propose to examine your potential collaborator's data.

## Language skills

## Consistency and reliability over time
If you promise something, make sure you deliver exactly what was promised when you have promised it.

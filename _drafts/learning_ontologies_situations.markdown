Learning ontology

Concept of an ontology is and incomplete definition, as it doesn't take into consideration the situation. example the definition of a psychiatric disease, where a phenotype (what the patient reports and what the clinician sees) can lead to one categorization, while looking through the lens of a genome the classification can be completely different. In other words, it comes down to interpretation of how a thing or action should be described, and that's highly subjective, changing not only from person to person but also over time. 

One concept can have an infinite number of meanings, *meaning* being a concept under a specific situation. the meaning of a situated concept can then only be further specified if the individual will fix a certain number of surrounding situations, and this could potentially be done through crowdsourcing as reactions to a given concept. in order for this to happen, those situations would have to be automatically captured, so that their meaning can be mapped over time.

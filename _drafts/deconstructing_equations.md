This post is actually an expansion of something I wrote on [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/106268032364497388036/posts/McTvKEVX5UW) and which is an idea that has been hunting me down for a while. 

1. break an equation down into its components. call this the hacking approach, which is used around the Web in quite a few places - check http://goo.gl/KgjaT for an excellent example. pre-requisites are obviously some set theory (basically the language behind math), proof principles, calculus, and linear algebra - provide references

2. test each component in isolation
3. bring them all together to check their behavior

inspiration for this came in part from SD [partial-model testing](http://www.systemdynamics.org/conferences/1983/proceed/parallel-vol2/homer920.pdf) by Jack Holmer](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=1815063&authType=NAME_SEARCH&authToken=a4P7&locale=en_US&srchid=56292141378682048157&srchindex=1&srchtotal=8&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A56292141378682048157%2CVSRPtargetId%3A1815063%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary)

intention is not to replace proofs, that would be stupid to say the least. instead, the goal is to increase the intelligibility by those who, like me, did some proofs in grad school but who don't have the mathematical sophistication to understand complex math.

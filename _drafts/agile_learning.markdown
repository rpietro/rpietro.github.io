# what does Agile mean in terms of online learning

focus Agile is on clients, which in online learning translates into students

iterative cycles, short, incomplete but functioning

how this translates: run a market research survey, deploy the simplest possible version and start listening

simple means short and with as little technological bells and whistles as you can

measure and experiment

borrow concept from qualitative research saturation

1. read a paper <!-- link how to read post --> and store it <!-- link to post on jabref -->
2. take main concept or concepts relevant to the point to be made in your paper and add it to a graph <!-- link to post on graphviz -->
3. start from the graph and create a narrative, which does not necessarily have to include all nodes and edges

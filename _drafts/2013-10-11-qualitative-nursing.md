Since the late eighties, the world of clinical research has been taken by the belief that clinical trials are the answer to every question one might have. While clinical trial unquestionably have a central role in establishing clinical practices, multiple authors have also pointed that trials alone cannot and should not be the only source of evidence guiding clinical care and clinical research. <!-- ref -->

In this post, I will argue that nurses are arguably the best qualified healthcare professionals to conduct qualitative research, and in fact that qualitative research should be a part of their daily routine whenever possible.

But what is qualitative research and why are nurses so central to its process? Below is my personal take:

## Talking rather than measuring
Qualitative research is primarily about talking and observing rather than measuring. Data are collected through, among other means, interviews with participants where researchers attempt to learn as much as possible about the problem, using the participant's perspective. 

Nurse's already have a great degree of interaction with patients, arguably more than any other healthcare professional. Therefore, to ask them to interact with patients in the role of research participants is just a natural extension of what they already do during their regular activities.


## Exploration rather than pre-conceived assumptions

Qualitative research is about exploring problems in depth, rather than simply testing to see whether the researcher's idea is right or wrong. In other words, in a qualitative research protocol if a researcher is not learning something new, that she had no idea when the whole project started, then the project is likely not being done correctly.

Nurses are uniquely positioned to achieve depth in qualitative research since they were trained to listen. In contrast with, say, most physicians who are near technicians in search of a diagnosis that can then be translated to a therapy, nurses are trained to hear what patients have to say in a humane interaction.

3. Flexibility throughout the protocol rather than a stiff plan

Qualitative research dynamically changes its protocol as the researcher learns more and more about the topic. This means that if a participant says that a cause of her suffering was factor X, the researcher will then explore with other participants to see whether that same factor also holds true among them. This is in contrast with most quantitative studies where the protocol will remain the same unless there is a demonstrated risk to participant's health.

Nurses are trained to be managers, and as managers they are flexible enough to see that solving a problem is more important than "following the manual."



## Articulating different concepts in a complex scenario rather than artificially breaking them down into small pieces

Qualitative research results in a series of intertwined factors that attept to explain a given phenomenon. This is in contrast with quantitative research's attempt to present one single cause to the problem. This approach does not necessarily work, as is evident from the often conflicting results from meta-analysis including studies that can all but agree. <!-- ref -->

Because nurses are trained to navigate the often chaotic healthcare system, complexity is something they are not afraid of. Instead, nurses thrive in a chaos since they are arguably one of the few who can manage it to get things done.

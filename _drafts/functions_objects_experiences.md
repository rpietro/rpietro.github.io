The other day I was reading somewhere that in the R stats language almost everything is either an object and/or a function. If you like to think in terms of semantics, this does make sense in that you can create meaning by making an object generate action through a function to create another object.

It's then tempting to establish an analogy with learning to say that when trying to teach a skill to somebody all you need is to show them how to gather the raw material to put the skill to practice (an object) and then to teach this person to put the skill in action (function), so that an endproduct (a resulting object) can be generated. Sounds perfect, except that the mix with humans has a component that, at least so far, is not present among humans: Experience.

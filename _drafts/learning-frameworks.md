I have spoken before about frameworks <!-- link --> as different ways to facilitate online learning by students. Frameworks are simply theoretical descriptions of the general concepts involved in a presentation format along with the multiple variables that might be tweaked within that framework. For example, one framework could be a step-by-step description of a certain skill, and the variables within this framework could be things such as whether the accompanying videos are long or short, whether the student has access to questions posed by previous students, among other variations within that framework.

Of course, there is no such thing as a framework encyclopedia, different people will list different concepts, boundaries between concepts and even what exactly should constitute a framework. This is all to say that what follows is simply a list with some personal thoughts:

## Step by step learning
The main concept here is to provide students with a step-by-step sequence on how to put an ability to practice. For example, in a course about writing the Introduction section of a scientific paper, students would go through slides, videos about each slides and then a video showing a hands-on presentation of the following steps:

1. How to write the first paragraph emphasizing the significance of the topic
2. How to write a short line stating the gap in the literature that the researcher intends to address in this manuscript
3. How to focus the literature review on statements that will reinforce the existence of the gap without deviating into secondary topics
4. How to write the objective paragraph so that it perfectly aligns with the gap

Variables in the walk through framework could include the length of the videos, embedding exercises within the presentation or right after it, among many other variations.

## Errors and fixes 

The erros and fixes framework usually comes after the walk through focuses on 

## Group or 1:1 video conferences

## In person 


## Extending your brain through social connections

static, dynamic, how to ask


## Extending yourself through technology

2. lit search on specific topic 
    * plugin
    * article tagging
    * cloud
    * storage
    * then apply to specific clinical areas
6. visual feedback with diagrams 
1. AIG and proctoring
3. 3D models 
9. input/output 
    * start with output
    * dissect in terms of what can be done with it regarding input and data analysis method
    * provide additional examples
    * provide a few quizzes
10. equation hacking 
11. blending 
12. agile - cycling and feedback from main stakeholder
12. repetition for tacit learning
13. embodied: emotion, narrative, role model
16. embedded: wearable computing, internet of things
17. enacted: repetition toward tacit knowledge

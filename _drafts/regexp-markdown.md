was watching this outstanding video on [regular expressions with Sublime Text](https://tutsplus.com/lesson/regular-expressions-in-sublime/) where [Jeffrey Way](https://tutsplus.com/author/jeffreyway/) talks about searching within HTML tags. Then I thought it would be interesting to do something similar with Markdown, which happens to be even easier since Markdown is semantic.

real funny, i usually write blog posts as a stream of consciousness kind of thing, primarily because it helps me think about new things and get my thoughts organized. but then the other day one guy made a comment regarding markdown on one of my google+ posts and i decided to write a blog post with an overview. i remember that right in the middle i was questioning myself whether that thing would be any good, since there is so much material out there. anyway, i finished the thing by assembling a ton of sparse information and talking about my own experience using the stuff rather than just repeating what others said. to my surprise, people loved it, and now they are resharing it more than any other previous post on my brand new blog http://goo.gl/9E4AYZ

i think that there is a lesson here that goes beyond blogging and that might spread into our initial efforts to build courses for the healthcare area, where we've been debating whether it would be worth writing a short course about a topic when there is ton of stuff out there on the topic. here are the thoughts about course creation, but bear in mind that these ideas are evolving and changing:

1. aggregate sparse, cutting edge info about the topic - for this you have to do a lot of research to find new things and then test them yourself
2. make it practical - most people just want to get things done, no bs in the middle. making it practical can be done by creating a walk through, step-by-step course, but there also a few other ways. later on I will post something on the educational frameworks to explore a topic on a course - if you want to take a pic, the draft for the future post is at http://goo.gl/C1lsaM 
3. you have to talk about something you've done - this might sound like an obvious thing to say, but by being the expert in the area you almost automatically know where the sparse stuff is and you've tried it yourself a number of times

i will transform this message into a blog post and get it out soon. btw, let me know if you would like me to post about something in special. i'm becoming a blog posting ninja, haven't missed a single day in several weeks, right now i am almost a week ahead of my daily posting schedule and have exactly 215 drafts http://goo.gl/XqWZHT as ideas for upcoming posts (thanks jekyll for static blogging platforms!!). but i am just a grasshoper http://goo.gl/oRIg in this art, and so copying the blogging ninja masters Kentaro Mori and Rafael Bento for any other insights

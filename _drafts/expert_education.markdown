I have heard a number of times that experts do not need structured learning environments, all they need is freedom to explore. While I certainly agree with the freedom portion, I think the portion on not needing structured learning environments is plain wrong. Here is why:

1. An expert has a focus in one area, but to innovate experts will often, if not always, have to go outside of their domains of expertise. At the boundaries with another discipline every expert becomes a novice. This is what [Gallison]() calls a trading zone, or a place of exchange with people from other fields. I would call this horizontal expansion
1. Within their field of expertise, experts need to be fed with problems at the edge of their current level of expertise so that they can be expanding their expertise to a deeper and deeper level. ladder mechanism since it takes a lot of effort to get to a distilled problem. vertical expansion

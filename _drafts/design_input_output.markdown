For a long time clinical researchers and data science specialists have lived in separate worlds, where a data science specialist knows little about the clinical aspects of an analysis and the clinical research knows next to nothing about data analysis. Some people have called this a turf protection from the traditional statisticians' perspective, but in reality it's just both sides shooting themselves in the foot. Rather than protecting turf, the lack of appropriate communication not only reduces the overall quality of the final work, but it also decreases the odds that the clinical research specialist will try to dig deeper into the vast array of techniques the data scientist might have.

The absurdity of this whole situation relied by and large on the idea that in some fields such as data sciences would either know everything and become *one of them* or nothing at all. The problem with the proverbial "little knowledge" is that it might hold true when you are acting alone, but if you work in an interdisciplinary group then the little knowledge can go a long way in making sure that both sides can communicate, progressively learn from each other, and ultimately just do a good job in whatever they might be working on.

But how do you get started? In other words, if a clinical researcher is interested in learning more about data analysis do we have to start by proving Bayes theorem? Well, I am of the opinion that the first step is to simply equip a clinical researcher with the bare minimum communication tools to be able to talk with a data science specialist. One of those tools is to have a basic input-output knowledge about different data analysis methods. The basic idea here is that for any given analysis methods the biomedical research should know what is the type of data that should go in, and what type of result it should provide as an output?

With the possibility of creating blog posts in static sites, I will argue that there is now little difference between what one can do in a regular scientific paper and in a simple blog post. Here is why:

1. Using [Markdown]() and embedded statistical analyses using the [R language](), one can have the entire data analysis entirely [reproducible](). This means that that the underlying data is connected and generates each and every result in the post
2. Each and every version of the post in previous drafts is recorded in an underlying versioning system such as [Git]() or [github](). This standard actually significantly improves upon what is currently done for 
2. search engines such as google scholar, which captures information not only from formal journals but also from other sources
3. peers through comments
4. exposure to potential funding - the idea of portfolios as having formats other than simply a journal publication
5. although I am talking here about blog posts, the same could be accomplished through slides with packages such as [slidify]()

But then what is missing? I would say that the main missing piece is the gamification imposed upon academic researchers . Journal impact, article impact, and other indicators such as the [h index]() such  This gamification is what provides the status academic researchers fight for and brag about

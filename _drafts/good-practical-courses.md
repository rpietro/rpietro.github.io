1. aggregate sparse, cutting edge info about the topic - for this you have to do a lot of research to find new things and then test them yourself
2. make it practical - most people just want to get things done, no bs in the middle. making it practical can be done by creating a walk through, step-by-step course, but there also a few other ways. later on I will post something on the educational frameworks to explore a topic on a course - if you want to take a pic, the draft for the future post is at http://goo.gl/C1lsaM 
3. you have to talk about something you've done yourself - this might sound like an obvious thing to say, but by being the expert in the area you almost automatically know where the sparse stuff is and you've tried it yourself a number of times

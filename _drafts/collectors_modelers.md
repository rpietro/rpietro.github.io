One would think that educational research focused on data collection and modeling would necessarily go together, but in practice the two form different feuds. Like in Physics where some individuals are focused on collecting data while others spend their time modeling that same data, education research tends to go in the same direction.

Bu what do they actually do? On the surface, collectors focus on the logistics and politics associated with the gathering of key variables/fields/questions that are non-existing in most datasets. Depending on the size of the project, the associated efforts can be daunting, in that projects are constantly threatened by budget cuts, capable teams are hard to train and put together, and the management has to be close otherwise quality will suffer. 

On the other side of the world, modelers focus on treating and combining existing data to extract information that wasn't previously available. Modelers as a group will keep searching for places where their skills might be needed, meaning where funding from collectors might be available to cover their salaries.

key is to work in an agile manner, building the simplest possible course model and then start adding & killing features as you go

pros is that the model is safe, if you get it wrong, little investment went into putting the whole thing together and so you can always paddle back

testing happens along the way, with students, but then creating a testing environment:

* easy feedback
* frequent conversations to know whether something might not be going right
* immediate fix for whatever new bug
* randomized experiments

that being said, where the first simple model aims is crucial, meaning that if you start by heading north but south was the way you wanted to go, odds are that you might never end up getting where you wanted

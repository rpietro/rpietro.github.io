Hindsight is 20/20, and I myself struggled in multiple attempts to scale up coaching programs in academics. And so this all to say that the following post is in no way a criticism of [Tutorspree, which has recently shut down](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/After-Raising-1-8-Million-Y-Combinator-Startup-4797113.php).

To make a long story short, the founders themselves acknowledge that the main problem they faced was scalability, and that's not surprising. Good quality coaching is such a personal endeavor, requiring a lot of energy from the coach to deeply understand not only the area of the person being coached, but also his/her skills and weaknesses. So, it's almos like doing it yourself, except that you do not have (and don't want to have) a great degree of control over what exactly the person being coached will do.

So, does all this means that it is impossible to scale coaching up. I don't think so, but in order to do it well I think requires some basic principles:


1. niches
2. infrastructure with content
3. always evolving standards
4. communication platforms - easy today
5. Ladder - [mentioned in a previous post](http://rpietro.github.io/situated_cognition,/big_data/2013/08/30/whole_task_ladder/) needs to have material to help and standardize coaching activities, not only about the matching

why philosophy education matters

it's the underlying basis behind everything we do. problem is, because there are some dominant ideas that overshadow each and every other idea, people are usually blinded by the central idea and do not see their problems

what is missing however, is a way to "hack into philosophy"

mapping of situated schemata - not only concepts but also the situations that are commonly attached to it

role of lsa, sna, qca with practical implications: direct communication between the underlying philosophical underpinning and the way students get their education

simplistic example with constructivism in education

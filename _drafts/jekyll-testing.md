1. easiest setup for me was to create a github.io page, replace its entire content with somebody else's blog (my post has a link to a bunch), and then start editing the content with my info and preferences
2. once you have the barebones blog working, then run a local server with "jekyll serve --watch" on your local blog directory, and keep testing everything you can get your hands on: js mustaches from their documentation, different html templates setting, css, ...

check for jekyll documentation on what can be tested

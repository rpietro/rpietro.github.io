In a previous post I mentioned [Merrienboer's Complex Learning]() [Instructional Design Model]() and so I thought I would give a personal perspective on some of its components. This post is by no means a summary of his whole model, which is not only rich but constantly evolving, and so I would strongly recommend that you read his book if this might pick your interest.

One of the main bases behind Merrienboer's theory is the concept that students should be educated based on what he calls whole tasks.

public education portfolio is not only about what you might have to show for yourself, but actually comes down to what society expects to see from students

comes down to what can be done with what a person knows far more than just what one knows. the two are essentially different:

1. ability to search and absorb concepts and tools to learn more
2. extension through social connections and group work
3. ability to keep yourself motivated


but how do you communicate that? here i won't go into what might not be quantifiable, even though the non-quantifiable assessment can be the most valuable. that said, the boundaries between what is quantifiable or not keeps changing

no metric can be considered in isolation as they are not reliable

metrics:

1. ability to complete tasks
2. ability to work with others
3. ability to communicate
4. ability to interpret problems and design feasible and effective solutions

emergence of a standard educational portfolio that could then be coded and passed accros educational platforms

trading zone and education

aligned with the concept of whole tasks as they often require skills from multiple different disciplines

aligned with the concept of agile since you have to work in teams where each member has a different knowledge

data, methods, funding, situated schemata, people - has to get through extension social and tech, publicize and obtain funding through embodied and embedded (keep ideas in their environment)

can have the info but first need to establish a trade - something that will be beneficial to both sides - need to have info about what might be of value to them and then use embodied (mirror or empathy) to establish a trade

idea is to get used to extracting information from different environments and then combining them into the potential solution to the problem

make students go after others and tech to obtain info - challenge is how to evaluate this in a scalable manner - LSA

trading zone and education

aligned with the concept of whole tasks as they often require skills from multiple different disciplines

aligned with the concept of agile since you have to work in teams where each member has a different knowledge

data, methods, funding, situated schemata, people

go after specific social network groups and grab information from them - need way to grade this automatically????

have different characters teaching the student different things
idea is to get used to extracting information from different environments and then combining them into the potential solution to the problem

# Error recovery

![](http://sarahzabic.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/picture.jpg?w=474)

The typical feedback students receive when they get an exercise wrong is the correct answer. Although one certainly does want to know about the correct answer, perhaps a more important feedback is how to fix the wrong answer in the direction of a better answer, or the ability to recover from an error. 

Error recovery is likely better than just the isolated plain correct for a variety of reasons, to name a couple:

* this is what happens in real life. Life doesn't come with a second chance, and when you make a mistake you have to cope with the consequences, hopefully finding a way out of it. 
* learning how to get out of a mistake will likely make you remember that lesson forever. If all you have to remember is the correct answer, then the memories connecting to that lesson will be way too poor.

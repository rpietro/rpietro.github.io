		<h1>Educating innovators: a blogged book</h1>

<p>Just finished reading Nina Amir&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Blog-Book-Publish-ebook/dp/B0084IUD9S/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=">How to blog a book</a>. All in all it seems like an interesting, sound concept. </p>

<p>Although one would possibly question whether somebody would feel <em>cheated</em> in buying a book when parts of it are online, there is something about the book as a unit that is hard to describe. I noticed this when I started consulting <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham&#39;s book on R Advanced Programming</a>. I have probably read some of his chapters at least four times, and yet I can barely wait for the ebook to come out. Why? Perhaps it&#39;s because it will have a final touch to it, sections will be more connected than they are now. Looking back, these are probably not reasons that would justify the buying of a book, maybe I&#39;m just trying to rationalize the need to say thanks for putting together such a fantastic resource.</p>

<p>Now, whether I will be blogging a book once again? Probably not for a while, but never say never ...</p>

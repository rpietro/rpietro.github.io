		<h1>Mastering an experimental approach to mathematics: Are the expert skills similar to the ones displayed by experts trained in a traditional way?</h1>
		<p class="muted">01 August 2013</p>

		<p><img src="http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/EM/img/CassiniQuartic.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I recently came one more time across a post on <a href="https://plus.google.com/106268032364497388036/posts/3PGuie75xmx">what is it like to understand advanced mathematics?</a>. Although the number of people reaching the level of mastery described in this post are certain few, I wonder what would be the differences in the type of expertise and insight that would be developed when comparing traditional mathematicians vs. those trained primarily from an experimental perspective. I am actually not sure whether there are people who are solely trained as experimental mathematicians, but even a comparison with the ones primarily focusing on experimental mathematics would be fairly interesting. </p>

<p>Reason for my interest in this topic is that I identify this as the geek/Agile/constructivist/Merrienboer way of doing mathematics, something that <a href="http://www.carma.newcastle.edu.au/jon/">Jonathan Borwein</a> has been advocating for a while through several books, including his latest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Mathematical-Computing-ebook/dp/B00A7QHJR4/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375387549&amp;sr=1-1">An Introduction to Modern Mathematical Computing: With Mathematica</a>. Perhaps making the book focused on, say, <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> would make it more widely accessible, but regardless this is a very exciting field for mathematical education.</p>

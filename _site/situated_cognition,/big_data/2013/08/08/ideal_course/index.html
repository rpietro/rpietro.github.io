		<h1>An online course that people would really like to take</h1>
		<p class="muted">08 August 2013</p>

		<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Alexander_and_Aristotle.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I enrolled into an online course related to data analysis that I was really looking forward to taking. The instructor was the primary person in the field, I had read his whole book once and a few chapters multiple times. What an opportunity then to be able to ask questions and get answers from the guy himself.</p>

<p>But then the course started. And the course was a reference to the book along with a pdf with some really simplistic questions, and a board controlled by a really well-intended teaching assistant. </p>

<p>Of course I was disappointed and ended up dropping the course after a couple days. But then this experience got me thinking about what is it that I would like to see in a large online course, large here meaning a place where the instructor cannot spend time with individual students, but instead has to create an environments where all of them can be managed as a group. Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would like to work on something that is similar to the task I am trying to accomplish. So, if it&#39;s a certain type of data analysis, I would like to do it from a to z. This also means that I don&#39;t want the task to be broken down into small pieces to only at the end find out how all the parts come together.</li>
<li>I would like to have tips on where to search for information that might not be provided in the course static info and social</li>
<li>I would like to learn about new tools and also where I could find additional tool. The latter would ideally include static sources of information such as traditional journals or lists as well as social sources where I can interact and ask questions</li>
<li>I would like to learn from personal stories talking about their experience with what works and what not, biggest mistakes, early signs of success and whatever they would share while having a beer with me</li>
<li>i would like the course to adapt to me</li>
<li>i would like to make choices in relation to course path</li>
</ol>

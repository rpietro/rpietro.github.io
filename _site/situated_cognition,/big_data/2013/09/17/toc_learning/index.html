		<h1>Theory of constraints, vocation and learning</h1>
		<p class="muted">17 September 2013</p>

<p>From the mother of all knowledge, Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">Theory of Constraints (TOC) is defined as</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory of constraints (TOC) is a management paradigm that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of constraints. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses a focusing process to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you look closely, TOC is probably the modern version of vocational tests as a way to guide learning. Reason is that learning is no longer the response to a lifelong vocation, but instead a minute-by-minute, ever changing need in regular daily lives. For example, at this point I might need to learn how to write a short script to scrape a number of pages for my a paper I have to write, while in two hours I will need to learn the best possible way to run a meeting where members tend to be unfocused. None of these skills are captured by vocational tests, and yet these two skills are what I need the most at those very moments since without them I am highly constrained. My paper writing might take forever without scraping, and my meeting will be a disaster.</p>

<p>If you then think of learning as being determined by TOC, the two problems people putting learning systems in place will face are:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Problem identification</em>: How do you help people that the problem they have is addressable by a given skill? For example, I might think that writing that paper will indeed take six months, and that my messy meeting is just the way it is.</li>
<li><em>Skill identification</em>: How do you help somebody find out that, once they identify a problem, what they need to learn is a specific skill, when in multiple cases they might not even be aware of that skill? For example, most people don&#39;t know what scraping is.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problem and skill identification are both coaching components, and as we recently learned from <a href="http://rpietro.github.io/situated_cognition,/big_data/2013/09/16/coaching_learning/">Tutorspree&#39;s experience</a>, coaching is difficult to scale. Lots of work ahead of educators.</p>

		<h1>What does market research mean when you are talking about an experiential product?</h1>
		<p class="muted">14 September 2013</p>

<p>I&#39;ve written before about the <a href="http://rpietro.github.io/situated_cognition,/big_data/2013/08/08/agile_online_courses/">use of market research in online learning</a>, the main gist being that before you invest a ton of time on a course product with some new spin, you should first test the market. In other words, the principle should be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Pull-Smartly-Things-ebook/dp/B0039KO9ZK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=8-1&amp;qid=1378912778">pull</a> rather than push.</p>

<p>But then if your new learning product involves a new type of experience, then it could be hard or next to impossible to convey what that new experience would be in a market research survey. For example, if your course is about to create a new level of personalization and interaction, that experience won&#39;t get through in a short description or even in a well-crafted video. People have to try it so that they might get a better idea on whether they would like to pay for the product and exactly how much they would be willing to pay.</p>

<p>This is why I am now thinking that market research might be simply the first iterative cycle in an Agile chain. The process then should start with a market research, followed by an immediate release of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">minimum viable product (MVP)</a>. Only then increments to that product are made through a series of small randomized experiments. </p>

<p>In this context, market research is not a definitive step, do or die. Instead, market research is just the start of an extensive experiment where the path can be re-oriented dynamically oriented as you go. So, if a given niche wants personalization, then given then the type of personalization they want. If their main need is deep content, then deep content it is, and so on.</p>

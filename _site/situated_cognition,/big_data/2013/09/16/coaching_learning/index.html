		<h1>Tutorspree, coaching and scalability</h1>
		<p class="muted">16 September 2013</p>

<p>Hindsight is 20/20, and I myself struggled in multiple attempts to scale up coaching programs in academics. And so this all to say that the following post is in no way a criticism of <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/After-Raising-1-8-Million-Y-Combinator-Startup-4797113.php">Tutorspree, which has recently shut down</a>.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, the founders themselves acknowledge that the main problem they faced was scalability, and that&#39;s not surprising. Good quality coaching is such a personal endeavor, requiring a lot of energy from the coach to deeply understand not only the area of the person being coached, but also his/her skills and weaknesses. So, it&#39;s almost like doing it yourself, except that you do not have (and don&#39;t want to have) a great degree of control over what exactly the person being coached will do.</p>

<p>So, does all this means that it is impossible to scale coaching up. I don&#39;t think so, but in order to do it well it likely requires some basic principles if you are attempting to create a coaching environment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Niches: coaching is a specialized activity, and so you&#39;ve got to segment your groups. One fits all is hard. For example, it would be difficult to create a single environment to coach programmers and healthcare professionals side by side. They require different content, with content being presented in different formats.</li>
<li>Provide good support content so that coaches&#39; time can be spent on problem and skill needs identification: Coaches are good because they can pinpoint what the likely problem is in a given situation, and then point the person being coached to the skill he will likely need to address that problem. A good environment for coaching therefore needs to provide good content presented in an adequate framework. </li>
<li>Good content: Having access to good content will save coaches&#39; time and therefore attract them. Think about it, if I am coaching somebody and then have to explain every single detail on my own, my life would be a living hell. If instead I can focus on identifying problems and then simply pointing the people I coach to good material, my job is significantly simplified. Goes without saying that the coach herself has to be trained to locate this content. Ultimate result here is what I <a href="http://rpietro.github.io/situated_cognition,/big_data/2013/08/30/whole_task_ladder/">mentioned in a previous post</a> as a ladder: If the person can learn the basics from good, automatic content in the form of videos, slides, exercises, etc, then the coaching time will be optimized.</li>
<li>Good content placed in a variety of learning frameworks: good content resources used by coaches have to be constantly evolving not only in terms of format. For example, a step-by-step learning material might be a great resource at one point, but later on a coach might want to point the person being coached to a learning material that instead talks about the most common errors in a certain field. &quot;Step by step&quot; material and learning by showing common &quot;errors and fixes&quot; are different frameworks to present the same problem, both needed in different situations.</li>
<li>Communication platforms: In our day and age, it&#39;s unlikely that your dream come true coach will be your next door neightboor. Communication platforms used to be very difficult to find a few years ago, nowadays we have plenty of good options. <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/">Google Hangouts</a> are my favorite, provided the coach and the person being coached both have access to a decent Internet connection and are reasonably computer literate. </li>
<li>Coaching mentality: To be a coach you have to think like a coach or, even better, you have to like to be a coach. In other words, you have to think about the other person first. Finding the right person used to be a nightmare, since you had to define psychometric characteristics that were predictive of good coaching and then hope that they would work. They usually wouldn&#39;t. But now there are social networks, which allow people to communicate about who the good and bad coaches might be. So, way less of a problem.</li>
</ol>

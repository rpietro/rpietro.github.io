		<h1>Coaching researchers: Beginning a series of posts</h1>
		<p class="muted">27 September 2013</p>

<p>I am starting a series of posts I plan on publishing about practical suggestions for researchers. My experience stems from having <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F5m0nQoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">published in clinical and health services research</a> for many years, as well as having run a coaching program targeting junior faculty members at Duke University and a few other institutions. All this means is that my posts will frequently use examples related to the biomedical and data sciences, but I also believe that most of the content can be extrapolated to other research areas.</p>

<p>Each of these posts will be available in English and Portuguese versions, usually posted in consecutive days. They will also be published to the respective Global and Brazilian versions of a Facebook Group page, the Brazilian page [already being available]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/578812732155954/?bookmark_t=group). Other languages might follow depending on whether the posts generate some interest. </p>

<p>Enough said, let&#39;s get to work ...</p>
